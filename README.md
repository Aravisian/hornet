Hornet-GTK-theme

Hornet for XFCE linux desktop.Cinnamon or Mate Desktop.
Includes theme for Stark menu, Cinnamenu, Whiskermenu or ZorinMenuLite

I do mostly Blue themes, all dark themes. I have done red. Since I dislike the color yellow, I decided to see if I could make a theme even in a color I do not like. Admittedly, I geared toward more Gold Tones... The working title of this became "Stingy" about halfway through the project. Then I named it Hornet. I did not think that "sudo apt install stingy" really worked out...

Fix Firefox:
Open "Customize Toolbar" and check the box for "titlebars".

Other Web browsers: Often, you can right click on the titlebar and select "Use System Titlebars".
